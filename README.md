# Commercial Draft

**The fantasy league for the world's most expensive ads.**

Draft Super Bowl commercials. Compete with friends. Crown the winner.

---

## Why?

Super Bowl Sunday is the one night we all become ad critics. Commercial Draft turns that into a game—no signup friction, no heavy app. Just create a room, share a code, and you're drafting.

## What makes it work

- **Room-first** — You're the host. Create a room, get a 6‑char code, share it. That's it.
- **Inherently multiplayer** — Snake draft, turn-based, real-time. Everyone sees picks as they happen.
- **Lightweight** — Runs in the browser. No app store, no installs. Join from your phone at the party.
- **Zero overhead** — No fantasy commissioner setup. Draft, rate, done.

## How it works

1. **Create or join** — Host a room or enter a code
2. **Draft** — Snake-draft brands before kickoff
3. **Rate** — Score each commercial as it airs
4. **Win** — Highest total wins the room
